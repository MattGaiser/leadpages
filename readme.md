# Leadpages ETL Demonstration

A project is never perfect, particularly when one is building for an ambiguous future (such as an interview driven animal focused startup). To keep this exercise within a reasonable amount of time, the following shall be out of scope:

- All the auto generated boilerplate in `settings.py` has been left in the project. Yes, a lot is not needed, but it would take a fair bit of time to clean up.
- General Django new project best practices, such as overriding the default user model, setting models to UUIDs by default, or versioning the API.
- Authentication. The test API has none and this API will not be secured by one. 
- Substantial logging and general error handling beyond the problems specified in the task. 

## A Brief Architectural Discussion

### Why Django?

### Why Celery?
